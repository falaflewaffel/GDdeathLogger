# PLEASE READ
Due to 2.2's release this program currently does not work.

# GD Death Logger
A program that logs deaths in a Geometry Dash level past a specified percentage.

## Download
Go to the "Releases" tab and download the latest .zip file. You'll get a folder containing the .exe and another folder named 'levels'.

# Usage
You'll see a cool GUI. Click 'Start' and then you're taken to the main menu, which has 3 buttons.

### GDdeathLogger
Open GD before selecting this. Then you'll be prompted to input your respawn time, filename to record deaths to, and the ID of the level. Then just play the level.

### Convert to Description
This takes a properly formatted file from GDdeathLogger and converts it to a reader-friendly format that is commonly used in YouTube video descriptions of level completions.

### Exit
